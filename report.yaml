product_narrative:
  Team 222's Social Collaboration feature will both simply and diversify your listening
  experience with friends and family by providing a collaborative environment based on
  individual taste profiles of user-generated groups. One of the pain points we identified in our
  user research was the difficulty of deciding what to play in a group setting or sharing music 
  or podcast contents. This problem arises in the narratives of...
    1. User finding it difficult to share, set up, and maintain playlists with friends
    2. User experiencing friction in finding new contents on Spotify and only trusting friends
        and family as a source of recommendation
    3. User desiring an engaging tool to co-create playlists in events
  Our solution will allow users to create custom groups of shared listeners and suggest
  playlists of music and podcasts based on data analytics and algorithms, which is the key
  strength of Spotify. By doing this, we aspire to deliver collaborative personalization
  experience to users and create a sense of community and social listening experience.
